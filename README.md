## Project Description
**Team Name:** GeoPerception

**Team Members:**

**Project:** Analyze Geodata from Twitter (or other similar geotagged sources) to map trends in hashtags or related keywords throughout a history.

**Extended Idea:** Use historical trends to predict trends within that keyword. For example, we might be able to analyze keywords that are commonly used when using the hashtag “#depressed” to map out behavior of a tweeter that may be depressed. In this way we can aggregate data throughout history and see trends in populations and correlate them to events happening in real live ( maybe it has been cloudy for a month straight ).

## Workflow

* Checkout to a new feature branch
* Commit you work to that branch
* Push that branch to Github
* Create a Pull Request to merge back
* Once the team approves and all tests pass, we merge!
