		<h3> About Our Project </h3>
		<p>This project analyzes Geodata to map the trends of hashtags on Twitter. Searching for a hastag finds all tweets that have used that specific hashtag, and visually maps it to google. By mapping these hashtags, we can get insights into real world events by comparing our mapped data to a real world context. For instance, you can see trends in world events going on by looking at tweets such as <b>#NepalEarthquake</b> or <b>#Baltimore Riots</b> and see the distribution of people tweeting about these events. This app also can help you find things that are trending on the internet by displaying the top hashtags in an easy to read bar-graph.

			<h3>Cassandra </h3>
			<p>All of our tweet storage is done using Cassandra and accessed via the Datastax api. As a robust NoSQL database, it was perfect for storing large amounts of data that can be accessed quickly via a tweet Id.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4" ><img src="../static/images/About Page Images/storm.png" class="img-team"></div>
		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h3> Storm </h3>
			<p>We were able to do real time processing on twitter's Firehose API using the powerful capabilities of Storm. This platform helped us parse tweets, count hashtags, store our data into our Cassandra Database, and all while new data was constantly streaming in.</p>

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h3> Elastic Search </h3>
			<p>We implemented Elastic Search in order to be able to search for a desired hashtag in our database. This search engine connects directly to our Cassandra database and creates an index of hashtags with their associated counts. When a user begins to enter a hashtag, a list is propagated asynchronously and displayed below the search field.</p>

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h3> Django/Python3 </h3>
			<p>We created our web frontend using the Django Python3 framework and using Apache to serve it. Because we decided to use Python 3 as the application language, there is no official support for Cassandra database connection. Luckily we were able to find a pull request that fixed most of the compatibility issues with Django/Python3/Cassandra</p>

			<h3> D3 </h3>
			<p>We needed a slick way to present the top trending hashtags we collected in our Cassandra database. We used D3's dynamic data visualization capabilities to create an interactive bar chart. When you click on a hashtag in the bar chart, it will scroll to the map and display that hashtag on the map.</p>

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h3> Google Maps API </h3>
			<p>We used the Google Maps API as a platform for plotting our tweet data. In conjunction with our Elastic Search implementation, you can search a hashtag and have tweets displayed at the proper geolocation on Google's map display.</p>

			<h3> Maven </h3>
			<p>Our storm application and cassandra-river plugin for elastic search used maven for managing dependencies and making deploys easy and quick. Besides its extreme lack of documentation, maven can save a lot of heartache as a project progresses and grows larger.</p>
